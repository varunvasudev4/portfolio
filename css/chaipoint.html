            There are around 3,000 different types of tea.According to the Eden Project: "The flavour of teas, like
            wines, depends on where they grow as well as the type of bush. Teas you buy are sometimes made up of
            different sorts blended together."Mint tea isn't actually a tea – it's an infusion."All teas that are
            classed as a tea have to come from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant," Kate Woollard, tea expert at
            Whittard, tells BuzzFeed. "A lot of companies have gotten into the habit of giving something the title 'tea'
            because it's something that you put in your cup and it's hot.

                    <strong>Black Tea:</strong>
                    Black tea is withered, fully oxidized and dried. Black tea commonly yields a hearty, amber-colored
                    brew.
                    Some of the most popular types of black teas are bold breakfast teas (e.g. English Breakfast, Irish
                    Breakfast) and Darjeelings.

                <p>
                    <strong>Green Tea:</strong>
                    Green tea production endeavors to avoid the oxidation of the tea leaves, in order to retain its
                    natural green color and fresh flavor. In Japan, the leaves are steamed, while other countries will
                    pan-fire or dry it through other methods. This type of tea has a more delicate flavor than black tea
                    and often brews up pale green or golden in color.

                    <strong>Oolong Tea:</strong>
                    Oolong tea is produced mainly in China and Taiwan and is only partially oxidized. This type of tea
                    can range from tasting similar to a fresh green tea, The flavor can vary widely, depending on where
                    the tea leaves are grown and how the tea is made.

                <p>
                    <strong>White Tea:</strong>
                    Originally from China, white tea is simply withered and dried, causing a very light oxidation. Its
                    flavor is most similar to that of green tea, but is usually more creamy, soft and sweet.

                    <strong>Pu-erh:</strong>
                    Pu-erh (also spelled pu'er) comes exclusively from China and is famous for its distinctively earthy
                    flavor. Pu-erh is tea that has been fermented, often stored underground for several years.
                    Traditionally, pu-erh is compressed into round cakes and can be very expensive.

                    <strong>Yellow Tea:</strong>
                    Yellow tea is the rarest type of tea. It is similarly processed to green tea, but is more slowly
                    dried to make the leaves take on a yellow color. The taste of the tea is mild, often described as
                    being somewhere between white and green tea.

                    <strong>Yerba Mate & Guayusa:</strong>
                    Yerba Mate and Guayusa are naturally caffeinated herbal infusions from South America. They are
                    treasured for their unique balance of caffeine and smooth, energizing effect. Yerba Mate is
                    herbaceous, vegetal and grassy with a bittersweet flavor, while Guayusa has an earthy, rich,
                    naturally smooth taste and a slightly sweet finish.

                    <strong>Herbal Tea:</strong>
                    Herbal tea is simply the combination of boiling water and botanicals like fruits, flowers, barks,
                    herbs, mints, spices, roots, berries and seeds.
